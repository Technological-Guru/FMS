## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture {#system-architecture}

### Overview
Every successful FRC event starts with solid architecture. Understanding this architecture isn't optional - it's essential.

### Network Topology

```
                    [FMS Server]
                    10.0.100.5
                        |
                  [Field Router]
                    10.0.100.1
                    /        \
          [Red Switch]        [Blue Switch]
               |                    |
        [DS1] [DS2] [DS3]    [DS1] [DS2] [DS3]
```

### Key Components

| Component | IP Address | Function |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| FMS Server | 10.0.100.5 | Main control system |
| Field Router | 10.0.100.1 | Network gateway |
| DHCP Range | 10.0.100.20-199 | Dynamic IP allocation |
| Red Alliance | VLAN 10 | Isolated network |
| Blue Alliance | VLAN 20 | Isolated network |

### ‚ö° Critical Notes
- The 10.0.100.5 IP is **hardcoded** in Driver Station software
- Each alliance must be on isolated VLANs for security
- WiFi SSIDs follow format: `[TeamNumber]_Robot`

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements {#hardware-requirements}

### Minnesota-Tested Equipment List

| Component | Minimum Spec | Recommended | Budget | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **FMS Computer** | 8GB RAM, i5, SSD | 16GB RAM, i7, NVMe | $800-1500 | Lenovo ThinkPad preferred |
| **Field Router** | AC1750, VLAN support | WiFi 6, managed | $100-300 | ASUS AX6000 tested |
| **Alliance Switches** | 8-port unmanaged | 8-port managed, PoE | $150-400 ea | Netgear GS308P proven |
| **Cabling** | CAT5e, indoor | CAT6, outdoor-rated | $200-500 | Monoprice recommended |
| **UPS** | 550VA | 1500VA | $100-300 | APC recommended |

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Minnesota-Specific Considerations

**Cold Weather Impact:**
- Standard electronics fail below 32¬∞F
- Always warm equipment before events
- Have backup hardware ready
- Test in actual venue conditions

**Venue Challenges:**
- School networks often block 10.0.100.x
- Coordinate with IT 48+ hours ahead
- Heated gyms cause WiFi interference
- Test range thoroughly
